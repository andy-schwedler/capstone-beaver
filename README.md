## Acknowledgments

I could not write a single line of code, 3 months ago when I started this journey. Now I know the difference between JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks.

Regardless of the outcome I have taken away many learnings from this application.

## Postscriptum

If you have made it to here, I thank you for taking your time with this project. I would like to acknowledge the support of my family, who had given me time and space for me to develope.
